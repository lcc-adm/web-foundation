# General Intro to Internet: Software

**by Natalie Bachman**

## What Software Infrastructure is needed:

Software infrastructure that the internet needs to function are operating systems, internet browsers, firewall, and TCP/IP protocol.

## Categories That Exist:

### Operating System:

The operating system is required to make the computer work as well as get connected to the internet. The operating system supports and manages all the programs and applications used by a device.

### Internet Browser:

The internet browser is used to locate and retrieve content from the web and display it on the user’s screen. It also converts HTML pages to www, giving it meaning. The browser’s main purpose is to translate the code that computers use to create websites and change them to be into text, graphics, and other features that us humans can comprehend.

### Firewall:

Firewalls are used to protect your computer against harmful programs and information by following a specific set of instructions to keep your computer secure. Firewalls guard the flow of information at ports or entry points where information is exchanged to external devices.

### TCP/IP Protocol:

Sets of standards that have to be followed while communicating on the internet. All machines must follow these rules when communicating in order for other machines to be able to understand the message.

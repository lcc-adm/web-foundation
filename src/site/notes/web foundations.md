# WEB FOUNDATIONS

This site serves as a simple foundation introduction to the internet and issues related to web design and development. Students were assigned different topics to research and explore. In addition to writing a short introduction to their topic, students were required to create a relevant illustration and include links to additional resources. Each student is credited on their individual page.

## DIGITAL MEDIA & DESIGN

The Digital Media & Design program is the visual design course at the [Eaton RESA Career Preparation Center](https://www.eatonresa.org/career-and-technical-education/career-preparation-center/) located at [Lansing Community College](https://lcc.edu/). Students are high-school juniors and seniors attending college level classes and potentially earning college credit. Over the course of one school year, students are introduced to basic Design and Communication concepts, computer graphic design using Photoshop, and web design & development. These courses are foundation classes in the Art & Design program at LCC.

[Chad Bennett](https://mister-chad.com/) is the course instructor. Please direct any questions or comments to him.
